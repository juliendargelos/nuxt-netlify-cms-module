> Easy [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) integration with nuxt.js

[ðŸ“– **Release Notes**](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Features

- Automatically build Netlify CMS through a seamless integration with nuxt.js webpack instance
- [Automatically serve Netlify CMS to a chosen path](#adminpath), in development and production builds
- [Support Netlify CMS config.yml](#netlify-cms-configyml), with automatic rebuild on change
- [Meant to be used with nuxtent-module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxtent-module), that allows nuxt to work with static content files

## Setup
- Add `nuxt-netlify-cms` and `netlify-cms` devDependencies using yarn or npm to your project

  `npm i -D nuxt-netlify-cms netlify-cms` OR `yarn add -D nuxt-netlify-cms netlify-cms`

- Require `nuxt-netlify-cms` at the start of `nuxt.config.js`

```js
var netlifyCmsModule = require("nuxt-netlify-cms").default;
```

:information_source: Note the `.default` in the above snippet. It is mandatory for this module, written in ES6, to work properly.
Please read [Misunderstanding ES6 Modules, Upgrading Babel, Tears, and a Solution](https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/misunderstanding-es6-modules-upgrading-babel-tears-and-a-solution-ad2d5ab93ce0) if you're interested to know why.

- Add `nuxt-netlify-cms` to `modules` section of `nuxt.config.js`

```js
{
  modules: [
    // Simple usage
    netlifyCmsModule,

    // With options
    [netlifyCmsModule, { adminPath: "secure" }],
  ],

  // You can optionally use global options instead of inline form
  netlifyCms: {
    adminPath: "secure"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Netlify CMS `config.yml`

You can specify a [custom configuration](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/#configuration), that will be parsed and merged with the module's [netlify CMS options](#cmsconfig).

You have to place the file in your [project root](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-rootdir/) and name it `netlify-cms.yml` instead of `config.yml`, for clarity.

:information_source: Note that each path in the file (`media_folder` and collections `folder` fields) will be rewritten to prepend nuxt.js [srcDir](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-srcdir/), so please specify each path relative to this folder.

This file can be changed while `nuxt dev` is running, and Netlify CMS will be updated automatically. At the moment, you'll have to refresh your browser window manually after the build is complete.

## Options
You can pass options using module options or `netlifyCms` section in `nuxt.config.js`.

### `adminPath`
- Default: `"admin"`

adminPath defines the path where Netlify CMS will be served.

With nuxt default configuration, it will be served to `http://localhost:3000/admin/` in development.

### `adminTitle`
- Default: `"Content Manager"`

adminTitle defines the html title of the page where Netlify CMS will be served.

### `cmsConfig`
- Default: `{
    media_folder: "static/uploads"
  }`

cmsConfig wholly reflects [Netlify CMS config.yml](#netlify-cms-configyml), in js object format.

:information_source: The order of precedence for the cms configuration is `defaults` < `netlify-cms.yml` < `module options`

:information_source: The paths are also rewritten according to nuxt.js [srcDir](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-srcdir/)

### `extensionsDir`: 
- Default: `"netlify-cms"`

extensionsDir defines the directory where this module will look for [Netlify CMS extensions](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/blob/master/docs/intro.md#customization) in *.js files to include in the build.

These are of two kinds, [Custom Previews](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/customization/) and [Widgets](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/extending/).

:information_source: This path will be rewritten to prepend nuxt.js [srcDir](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-srcdir/), so please specify it relative to this folder.

:information_source: The global variable `CMS` is available to these javascript files to reference the CMS object.

This directory can be changed while `nuxt dev` is running, and Netlify CMS will be updated automatically. At the moment, you'll have to refresh your browser window manually after the build is complete.
